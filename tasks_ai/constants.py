AGENT OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL:
0. HELP: Always use -j for JSON output. Use tasks <command> -h for any subcommand.
1. OUTPUT: Always use -j flag for machine-parseable JSON. 
   Schema: {"success": bool, "error": str|null, "messages": [str], "data": {}}
2. TASK REFERENCES: Use the numeric Id (e.g., "1") instead of the filename for all operations. 
   Run 'list' to see task Ids alongside titles.
3. MULTI-STEP MOVES: Push a task through multiple states in ONE command using comma-separated statuses.
   Example: 'tasks move 1 READY,PROGRESSING,TESTING' moves from BACKLOG directly to TESTING.
   This bypasses the need for 3 separate move commands.
4. CREATION: 'create' requires --story, --tech, --criteria, and --plan. 
   --repro is mandatory for --type issue. Titles must be >= 10 chars.
 6. REVIEW & REGRESSION CHECK:
    - When moving to REVIEW, a diff is auto-generated at `.tasks/review/<task_id>.patch`.
    - Audit the diff for regressions, breaking changes, or unexpected side-effects.
    - If issues found, move task back to PROGRESSING/TESTING to fix, then re-test.
    - Once clean, run `tasks modify <id> --regression-check` to set Rc flag.
    - STAGING/DONE/ARCHIVED transitions require Rc flag (regression check passed).
 7. PROGRESS: Use 'modify' to update --progress, --findings, or --mitigations.
    - Updates to the active task automatically sync to 'current-task.md'.
    - Use '.tasks/progressing/<task_id>/current-task.md' as primary scratchpad.
 8. SYNC: Use 'checkpoint' to pull git commits and current-task.md into task file.
    Use 'hammer sync' to keep testing, staging, and main branches aligned.
  9. ARCHIVING: When moving STAGING -> ARCHIVED:
     - Branch must be merged to main first (use 'hammer repo promote <branch>')
     - Use 'tasks move <id> ARCHIVED -y' to auto-push and delete branch
     - Or move to REJECTED if code was not merged
 10. BACKUP & RESTORE:
     - The 'tasks' branch (local and remote) serves as a continuous backup of the .tasks worktree.
     - Archiving a task automatically triggers a save to the remote 'tasks' branch.
     - Use 'hammer tasks restore' to recover .tasks from backup if lost or corrupted.
     - Use 'hammer tasks save' to manually create a backup at any time.
 11. RULES: 
     - All blockers (Bl) in metadata MUST be ARCHIVED before moving to PROGRESSING.
     - Use 'list' to find tasks and 'current' to see full metadata/logs.
 12. ERROR RECOVERY: If a command fails, read the 'error' field in the JSON response. 
     The 'hint' provides actionable next steps.
