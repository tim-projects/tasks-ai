AGENT OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL:
0. HELP: Always use -j for JSON output. Use tasks-ai <command> -h for help on any subcommand.
1. OUTPUT: Always use -j flag for machine-parseable JSON. 
   Schema: {"success": bool, "error": str|null, "messages": [str], "data": {}}
2. TASK REFERENCES: Use the numeric Id (e.g., "1") instead of the filename for all operations. 
   Run 'list' to see task Ids alongside titles.
3. MULTI-STEP MOVES: Push a task through multiple states in ONE command using comma-separated statuses.
   Example: 'tasks-ai move 1 READY,PROGRESSING,TESTING' moves from BACKLOG directly to TESTING.
   This bypasses the need for 3 separate move commands.
4. CREATION: 'create' requires --story, --tech, --criteria, and --plan. 
   --repro is mandatory for --type issue. Titles must be >= 10 chars.
5. LIFECYCLE: BACKLOG -> READY -> PROGRESSING -> TESTING -> REVIEW -> STAGING -> LIVE -> ARCHIVED.
   - Note: REVIEW and ARCHIVED tasks can move back to PROGRESSING if needed.
   - Task MUST be in PROGRESSING before modifying project code.
   - 'move' to PROGRESSING creates/syncs '.tasks/progressing/<task_id>/current-task.md'.
6. PROGRESS: Use 'modify' to update --progress, --findings, or --mitigations.
   - Updates to the active task automatically sync to its 'current-task.md'.
   - Use '.tasks/progressing/<task_id>/current-task.md' as your primary scratchpad while working.
7. SYNC: Use 'checkpoint' to pull git commits and current-task.md notes into the task file.
8. RULES: 
   - All blockers (Bl) in metadata MUST be ARCHIVED before moving to PROGRESSING.
   - Use 'list' to find tasks and 'current' to see full metadata/logs.
9. ERROR RECOVERY: If a command fails, read the 'error' field in the JSON response. 
   It will contain specific guidance and allowed next steps (HINT).
